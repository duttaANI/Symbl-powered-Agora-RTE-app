## Browser Support
Support for this application is available only for Chrome and Firefox.

## Credentials

1. Get your Symbl credentials (`App Id` and `App Secret`) from the [Symbl Platform Console](https://platform.symbl.ai).

2. Get your Agora credentials (`App Id` and `App Certificate`) from the [Agora Platform Console](https://console.agora.io/). See [here](https://www.agora.io/en/blog/how-to-get-started-with-agora/) for more information on how to do that.

### Setup the Database
1. Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). You can follow these [steps to install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/).
2. Create a database with the name of your choice. See [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/manage-ag-createdb.html) for more information.
3. Note the username, password, and database name that you have created. 

### Setup the Backend 

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/symblai/Symbl-powered-Agora-RTE-app).
2. Navigate to the `Symbl-Powered-Agora-Backend-master` directory and open the `config.json` file.
3. Add your Symbl `App Id` and `App Secret` values in the respective fields below:

``` 
"SYMBL_APPID": ""
"SYMBL_SECRET": ""
``` 
4. Add your Agora `App Id` and `App Certificate` values in the respective fields below:

``` 
"APP_ID": "",
"APP_CERTIFICATE": "",
``` 

5. Open the file models/db.go and replace the following line (19) within the CreateDB function:

```
db, err := gorm.Open("postgres", os.Getenv("PG_DB_DETAILS"))
```

with your PostgreSQL database user, password, host, and database name as described below:

```
db, err := gorm.Open("postgres","postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db_name>?sslmode=disable")
```

This sample application uses GORM for connecting to the PostgreSQL database and you can learn more about it [here](https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.html).

### Run the Backend server

1. Navigate to the `Symbl-Powered-Agora-Backend-master` directory and run the following command:
  
```
go run server.go
```

Your backend server should be running on port `8080` and you should see a log message similar to the following:

```
{"level":"debug","time":"9999-99-99T99:99:99-07:00","message":"Backend server running on port: 8080"}
```

You can also navigate to http://localhost:8080/test to make sure the server is up and running without any issues. You should see a sample web page as shown below.

### Setup the Frontend

1. Open the file `config.json` under the folder `Symbl-Powered-Agora-Master` and provide your Agora project name, display name, and App Id in the respective fields below:

```
"projectName": ""
"displayName": ""
"AppID":""
```

2. Add the Backend URL in the respective field below:

```
"backEndURL": "http://localhost:8080"
```

### Run the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `Symbl-Powered-Agora-master` directory and run the following command:
  
```
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary frontend dependencies.

2. Run the following command to start the frontend application:

```
npm run web 
```
    
Your frontend server should be running on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000). You should see the web application ready to be used as shown below.

### Testing the Application
With your backend and frontend servers up and running, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), click on the `Create a meeting` button, enter a room name and click the `Create a meeting` button again.

When the meeting URL is created, click on the `Enter Meeting (as host)` button to enter the meeting.
Select your camera, microphone and type your display name before clicking on the `Join Room` button.
